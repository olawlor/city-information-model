This is the top-level CIM storage for all Entities and Species.

All of these are stored as JSON files here for now, 
but this data storage should eventually get sharded and replicated
across a network-transparent interactive database, which will be crucial
for multiplayer.

Because this will be moving into a database, this should only store JSON 
files, not images or CAD files or other data.
